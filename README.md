## Build variants

Herein you can find multiple targets that the app takes into account:

|          |Staging    |Production  |
|----------|-----------|------------|  
|`Internal`|Debug      |Debug       |
|`External`|Release     |Release    |

Where the following formed variants are built for staging purposes:

- stagingInternalDebug
- stagingInternalRelease

And these ones for production purposes:

- productionInternalDebug
- productionInternalRelease
- productionExternalDebug
- productionExternalRelease

**_Sidenote:_** choose productionExternalDebug before executing the app
